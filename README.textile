h1. midnight

A library to parse natural language date/time into a cron expression.

<pre>Midnight.parse('every 5 minutes').to_s
 => "*/5 * * * *"</pre>

h2. Supported phrases

A full list of supported natural language phrases can be found in test_parsing.rb.

In the future there'll be support for more complex repetitions - a wishlist can be found in todo.md.

h2. Credits

My tokeniser code is based on the excellent <a href="https://github.com/yb66/tickle">Tickle</a> gem, which in turn relies on <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/chronic">Chronic</a> for date parsing.
